VisualizationToolHHRR

This project provides a tool for visualization data from companies in order to address problems related to Human Resources.
At this moment it provides visualization for three different questions.
The first one related to the wage gap between the Gender and Marital Status.
The second one related to the composition of the different departments in terms of diversity (Recruitment source, Gender and Race).
And the last one related to the employee satisfaction and perfomance by position and department.

The project has been concibed in modules in order to be accesible if more questions appear and want to be resolved.

This code has been developed by Carlos Alcoba , Javier Jim√©nez  and Javier Pozo.
